# WGM_analysis
Code used for FX29 HX711 force sensor signal analysis

The calibration factor.ino and measurement.ino scripts are based on files from https://github.com/sparkfun/HX711-Load-Cell-Amplifier adjusted to my needs.
The measurement script also uses an Arduino Library from https://github.com/bogde/HX711
